# The Height

This project was developed for the course 'Gamefeel' at HKU as part of a weekly iterative gamejam. 
The goal of this project was to create a game that feels and looks satisfying to play.
The code and organisation herein is therefore not optimal, and there is much to be improved upon.

## Description

'The Height' is a platformer-type game about a bird that is learning to fly, and to that end, is looking for the greatest mountaintop to do so. 
The player must navigate treetops, ride gusts of wind, and find secret paths in order to reach their goal.
This project remains a prototype, but is playable as a proof of concept.
